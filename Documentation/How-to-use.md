In order to get this app to work perfectly we need you to do some prerequisite tasks:
1) Go to [amazon india](https://www.amazon.in). (for international users go to your local amazon site).
2) On the top right corner you will find your profile which says Hello, your_name.
3) Click on manage your content and devices
4) Now go to preferences tab and click on 'Personal Document Settings'.
5) Click on add an email address 'Add a new approved e-mail address'. Then add 'bookkeeper61611@yahoo.com'.
6) In the same tab you will be able to find your kindle email for the device you want to send books to.

Voila! You are done. Star if you like this project. :D
